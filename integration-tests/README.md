# Setup
==============

In order to run all the Appium tests on your machine you need to install Python and pip. Please visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install a Python version that comes with pip.

After installing Python and pip open your terminal and run these commands.

```shell
pip install Appium-Python-Client
pip install pytest
```

## Running tests

In order yo run appium tests, you will need an instance of appium server running on your machine.

Before running integration tests make sure that the apk of the application was generated by command line and NOT by Android Studio, otherwise you might have problems installing the apk due to a -t flag.

Run this command on root folder of the project:
```shell
gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

### Running all tests
```shell
py.test .
```

### Running an specific test file
```shell
py.test tests.py
```
